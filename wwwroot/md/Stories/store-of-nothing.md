        this.visitors = [];
    }

    }

    walkAisles(visitor) {
        if (this.visitors.includes(visitor)) {
            console.log(`${visitor.name} is walking through the aisles, finding nothing.`);
        } else {
            console.log(`${visitor.name} is not in the store.`);
        }
    }

    leaveStore(visitor) {
        const index = this.visitors.indexOf(visitor);
        if (index !== -1) {
            this.visitors.splice(index, 1);
            console.log(`${visitor.name} has left ${this.name}.`);
        } else {
            console.log(`${visitor.name} was not in the store.`);
        }
    }
}

// Define a Visitor
class Visitor {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    visitStore(store) {
        store.enterStore(this);
        store.walkAisles(this);
        store.leaveStore(this);
    }
}

// Create a new store
const storeOfNothing = new StoreOfNothing("The Store of Nothing");

// Create a new visitor
const emily = new Visitor("Emily");

// Simulate Emily's visit to the store
emily.visitStore(storeOfNothing);
```

### Explanation
1. **StoreOfNothing Class**: This class represents the store. It has methods to enter the store, walk through the aisles, and leave the store.
2. **Visitor Class**: This class represents a visitor. It has a method to visit the store, which involves entering, walking through, and leaving the store.
3. **Simulation**: An instance of the store and a visitor are created. The visitor's visit to the store is simulated by calling the `visitStore` method.
