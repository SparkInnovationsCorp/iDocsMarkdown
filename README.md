# iDocsMarkdown
iDocsMarkdown is a dynamic, single-page documentation engine built using the iDocs template and enhanced with a robust backend using ASP.NET Core. This powerful tool leverages Bootstrap 4, Markdig for Markdown processing, and HtmlAgilityPack for HTML parsing, enabling you to create comprehensive offline and online documentation for your themes, templates, plugins, and software.

## What It Does
Essentially, this application operates on a directory of Markdown files, structured like this:

It then dynamically generates a beautifully navigable website, perfect for documentation purposes:

## How to Use
Download, compile and publish under Visual Studios 2022 into IIS or compatable web host.  Then simply update the MD docs in the MD folder.

## To-Do List
1. **Implement Caching for Enhanced Performance**  
   Plan to integrate caching mechanisms based on markdown file modification dates to significantly boost performance and reduce load times.
   
2. **Expand Theme Support**  
   Aim to include support for various other iDocs theme versions, providing users with more flexibility and customization options for their documentation needs.
